# ⚫ Darth - My AI Learning Playground

**"Learning the force of neural networks, one experiment at a time."**

This is my **darth** folder — where I'm building and learning AI concepts from scratch with **just Python and NumPy**. Named darth because... well, it sounds cool and I'm trying to master the "dark arts" of AI! 😄

This is my personal learning space where I:
- Experiment with implementing things from scratch  
- Try to understand how stuff actually works under the hood
- Build simple, readable code that I can learn from
- Have fun breaking and fixing things!

## 🎯 What's This About?

The `darth` folder is where I put my implementations and experiments.  
It's not meant to be a real framework - just my messy, evolving collection of "let's see if I can build this myself" attempts.

From linear regression to (hopefully someday) neural networks, this is where I tinker and learn by doing.

## 🧩 Design Philosophy

- **Clarity over performance:** Prioritize understanding of concepts over computational efficiency.
- **Minimal dependencies:** Stick to core Python and NumPy wherever possible.
- **Incremental learning:** Each algorithm builds upon the previous ones (e.g., linear → neural nets → transformers).
- **Reusability:** Common utilities (losses, activations, optimizers) are shared across implementations.
- **Testability:** Every core module should have corresponding unit tests to ensure correctness.

## 🏗️ How to Use

Once the repository is installed in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
