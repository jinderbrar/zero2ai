## 🌱 About

**zero2ai** is my personal journey to explore **machine learning** and **deep learning** by re-implementing things from scratch — one building block at a time.

it’s not meant to be another framework — just a space to tinker, break things, and learn how the magic works behind the scenes.

if you find it helpful, cool! if you find it interesting, even better 😄

## 🗺️ Roadmap — *from zero → ai*

A growing journey of curiosity and creation 🚀  
Each phase unlocks a deeper layer of understanding — from building the first neuron to exploring full attention mechanisms.

| 🏁 Phase | 🚀 Focus Area | 🎯 What’s Inside | 📍 Status |
|:--------:|:--------------|:----------------|:-----------:|
| 🧩 **1** | **Neural Networks** | Feedforward nets · activations · loss · backpropagation | 🚀 In Progress |
| ⚙️ **2** | **Deep Learning Bits** | Optimizers (Adam, Momentum) · weight initialization · regularization | 🧭 Planned |
| 🧠 **3** | **CNNs** | Convolution · pooling · simple image classifier | 🧭 Planned |
| 🔁 **4** | **Sequence Models** | RNN · LSTM · GRU · text & time-series | 🧭 Planned |
| ⚡ **5** | **Transformers** | Attention · encoder–decoder · mini-transformer | 🧭 Planned |


🧭 *Currently exploring:* building neural nets from scratch — gradients, activations & learning loops.
